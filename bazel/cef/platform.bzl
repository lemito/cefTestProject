# Use the following command to update platform information:
# % python3 ./tools/bazel/platform_updater.py [--arch=x86|x64|arm64|arm]
#
# This must be configured before running Bazel for the first time, or when a
# new target architecture is desired.
#
# By default (with no `--arch` argument), the host platform and architecture
# will be selected. Optionally specify a different architecture for cross-
# compilation. See the list of available architecture values below.
#
# Host platform:      windows
# Host architecture:  x64
#
# CEF architectures and platforms available to build on this host:
#       x86 = windows32
#       x64 = windows64    [default]
#     arm64 = windowsarm64
#
